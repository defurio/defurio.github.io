<!--									<h2>First Author Publications</h2> -->
									<p> I am originally from Tampa, Florida, and graduated from the University of Florida in 2016 with a B.S. in Physics 
										and Astronomy and a minor in Mathematics. While at UF, I first started astronomy research with Elizabeth Lada 
										characterizing the circumstellar disk population of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in nearby young star-forming 
										regions. Although I now exclusively study astrophysics, at UF I also worked in the biophysics lab of Stephen Hagen 
										where I explored the effects of oxidative stress on the genetic competence network of a type of bacteria that causes 
										cavities, Streptococcus mutans, and our results are published in the journal of Applied and Environmental Microbiology. <p> 

									<p> I then traded the swamps of Gainesville for the snow covered trees of Ann Arbor and received my PhD in Astronomy and 
										Astrophysics at the University of Michigan in 2023 where I worked with Michael Meyer. As a graduate student, I probed 
										the low-mass stellar and sub-stellar binary populations of the Orion Nebula Cluster, using the Hubble Space Telescope, 
										resulting in three papers that emphasize the importance of cluster dynamics in sculpting the companion population. In this 
										work, I developed and implemented a double PSF-fitting algorithm using empirical models capable of detecting companions at 
										sub-diffraction limit scales on HST/ACS. This work led to a Cycle 30 HST program that I lead to perform a multiplicity survey 
										down to 10 Jupiter masses in NGC 1333, an intermediate density young star-forming region. Since then, I have adapted this 
										technique to resolve companions on sub-diffraction limits scales on WFPC2/PC, WFC3/IR, WFC3/UVIS on HST and NIRCam, NIRISS, and MIRI on JWST. <p>

									<p> At UM, I led a long-baseline interferometry survey of nearby A-type stars in the Galactic field using the CHARA Array to 
										probe the close companion population down to 0.01 au. In two papers, I showed the likely increase in close companions with 
										primary mass, suggesting enhanced disk fragmentation for masses > 3 Msun. This survey is ongoing with the goal of a volume-complete 
										sample and so far has been awarded 14 nights at CHARA. At the end of my PhD, I joined the JWST NIRCam and NIRISS science teams, 
										focusing on free floating planetary mass objects in star-forming regions and field brown dwarfs. <p>

									<p> Since 2023, I have been working as an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdocotral Fellowship at the University of Texas at Austin. 
										My NSF fellowship research program is focused on describing the companion populations of stars in a variety of star-forming environments 
										to fully characterize the impact of cluster dynamics on the formation and evolution of multiple systems. For this project, I am working 
										with Gaia, Keck, and Gemini on the solar-type population in the Orion Nebula Cluster, Orion OB1a, and Orion OB1b which have experienced 
										very different environmental histories. This work is ongoing with the expectation of the survey paper completed in 2026.<p>

									<p> While an NSF fellow,  </p>
										
									<p>I have continued my exploration of the brown dwarf binary popualation as a part of several collaborations. We have discovered the only 
										two known Y-dwarf binary systems with JWST using my empirical PSF-fitting code, WISE0336 and WISE1935, and ruled out a companion to the 
										suspected binary Y-dwarf WISE1828 at separations > 0.5 au. This work led to a Cycle 31 HST program that I co-PI to perform the largest 
										brown dwarf multiplicity survey to date, mining the HST archive, and using my empirical PSF-fitting code. </p>
